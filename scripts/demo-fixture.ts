// Builds the sandbox the README screencast is recorded in: a directory holding a
// `bin/zapara` that runs this checkout against `tests/fixtures/busy-week` and nothing
// else. Every number on screen therefore comes from the synthetic fixture, never from
// a real transcript, which is what makes the recording publishable. The full recipe,
// including the WebP step and the budgets, is in the header of assets/demo.tape. Usage:
//
//   bun scripts/demo-fixture.ts            # a fresh directory under the system temp dir
//   bun scripts/demo-fixture.ts <dir>      # a directory of your choosing; see below
//   DIR=$(bun scripts/demo-fixture.ts) && PATH="$DIR/bin:$PATH" TZ=UTC vhs assets/demo.tape
//
// <dir> must not exist yet. The script never deletes anything: a typo such as $HOME must
// not be wiped, and no marker file could make that safe, since a marker can be planted.
//
// The only thing printed on stdout is the directory, so the line above can capture it.
