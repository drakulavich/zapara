// Five sessions at once with interrupts, rejections, questions and a plan review.

// calm() only ever adds 3 to an m that stops at 50, so it cannot overflow.
// Each reply carries 1000 output tokens (its own requestId, so none is deduped
// away), so a full storm hour reads 55 x 1000 = 55.0k tokens. Real heavy hours
// carry 60k-236k; at calm()'s 100 tokens a storm hour would read 5.5k and the
// reading component would be invisible in the week picture.
//
// `lastMin` is the last minute at which the storm may start an event, and it
// applies to every hour the call spans, not only the last one (every caller
// that passes it so far storms a single hour). A full storm hour caps the
// 40-minute streak norm on its own, so a storm meant to read below Fried has to
// stop short of the cap: see Friday below. The default sits above every m the
// loop can reach, so `m + 4 < 60` stays the only bound on a full hour and this
// parameter cannot silently become the binding one if that offset ever changes.
